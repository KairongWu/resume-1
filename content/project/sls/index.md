# Motivation
I used to be a 3D printing enthusiast, I reproduced some open-source FDM printers like kossel in middle school and realized the limitations of FDM 3D printers. I learned that SLS is a high-precision 3D printing method and can even print metal.

So I spent about one year building a desktop SLS 3d printer all by myself when I was in high school.
Although the project looks pretty naive now, the desktop SLS printer with the galvanometer had never been presented at that time to the authors’ best knowledge.
