abstract: This paper presents a real-time trajectory optimization and control method that allows the quadruped robot to bump the ball to the desired landing point. We first formulate the entire process as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem to obtain the optimal trajectory, takeoff state, and takeoff time. Then, an model predictive control (MPC) based jumping controller is developed with terminal cost, horizon cutting, and dynamic discretization time interval. Experimental results demonstrate Aliengo bumped a tennis ball released in 1.56 m. Our approach is fast enough to compute after the ball is released, general enough to perform accurate ball landing points in 7 different initial ball states and desired ball landing points with the same parameters.
